    "body": "There actually is an option, although it certainly isn't ideal. One can simply make a new EIP by modifying the old one. The upside is that everyone is happy and can choose which standard to implement. The downside is that now there are multiple competing standards.\r\n\r\nSo:\r\n- Inconsistencies are fine as long as they don't cause any contradictions\r\n- EIP-4907 will permanently have that inconsistency, but if new standards are proposed, you may feel free to choose whichever you prefer.\r\n- A new EIP that is more consistent with EIP-721 may be created. All EIPs are CC0-licenced, so new EIPs can contain any amount of content from other EIPs.",

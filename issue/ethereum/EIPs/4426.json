  "body": "I will keep this short and simple.\r\n\r\nBasically, when an event log for Transfer is emitted from a contract that is ERC20, it has the Topics[0] ID of `0xddf252ad1be2c89b69c2b068fc378daa952ba7f163c4a11628f55a4df523b3ef`, which is ultimately derived from `Transfer(address,address,uint256)`.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that ERC721 also has the exact same Topics[0] ID, but with a different use case. Namely, the uint256 is for TokenID and not for Amount.\r\n\r\nSomething should be added to the Topics ID such that it can be determined that the events are different.\r\n\r\nIf this is part of the design, please help me understand why?\r\n",

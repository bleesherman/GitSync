  "body": "## Abstract\r\n\r\nThis standard introduces a smart contract interface that can represent a batch of NFTs that are normally distributed around the true NFT but displayed randomly.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nA non-fungible token proposed in [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) is usually associated with a media content in the external world through a deterministic link to metadata with media inforamtion. This deterministic linkage can be improved with easy-to-use on-chain randomness such as Gassian random number generator proposed [here](https://github.com/simontianx/OnChainRNG/tree/main/GaussianRNG). The net effect is the ownership is still one, and the displayment can be random with centrality. This can be used in the NFT and GameFi domains.",
